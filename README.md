## Task 1 – Finding Pearson Correlation

### Data Collection
The data points were collected manually by hovering over the points on the provided online graph. The coordinates were recorded and stored in a CSV file.

### Methodology
Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated using the scipy.stats.pearsonr function. This method measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables.

### Results
The calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is:
- **r = 0.9977**
- **p-value ≈ 1.19 × 10⁻¹⁰**

This indicates a very strong positive linear correlation between the variables.

### Visualization
The scatter plot below shows the relationship between X and Y values, along with a fitted linear trend line.
